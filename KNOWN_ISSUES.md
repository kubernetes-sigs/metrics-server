## Kubelet doesn't report metrics for all or subset of nodes

**Symptoms**

If you run `kubectl top nodes` and not get metrics for all nods in the clusters or some nodes will return `<unknown>`  value. For example:
```
$ kubectl top nodes
NAME      CPU(cores)  CPU%       MEMORY(bytes)  MEMORY%
master-1  192m        2%         10874Mi        68%
node-1    582m        7%         9792Mi         61%
node-2    <unknown>   <unknown>  <unknown>      <unknown>
```

**Debugging**

Please check if your Kubelet returns correct node metrics.

You can do that by checking resource metrics on nodes that are missing metrics.

```console
NODE_NAME=<Name of node in your cluster>
kubectl get --raw /api/v1/nodes/$NODE_NAME/proxy/metrics/resource
```

If usage values are equal zero or timestamp is lost, means that there is problem is related to Kubelet and not Metrics Server. Metrics Server require value and timestamp of  `node_cpu_usage_seconds_total`  `node_memory_working_set_bytes`  `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total` and `container_memory_working_set_bytes` to not be zero or missed.

**Known causes**

* Nodes use cgroupv2 that are not supported as of Kubernetes 1.21.

**Workaround**

* Reconfigure/rollback the nodes to use use cgroupv1. For non-production clusters you might want to alternatily try out cgroupv2 alpha support in Kubernetes v1.22 https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2254.

## Kubelet doesn't report pod metrics

If you run `kubectl top pods` and not get metrics for the pod, even though pod is already running for over 1 minute. To confirm please check that Metrics Server has logged that there were not metrics available for pod.

You can get Metrics Server logs by running `kubectl -n kube-system logs -l k8s-app=metrics-server` (works with official manifests, if you installed Metrics Server different way you might need to tweak the command). Example log line you are looking for:
```
W1106 20:50:15.238493 73592 top_pod.go:265] Metrics not available for pod default/example, age: 22h29m11.238478174s
error: Metrics not available for pod default/example, age: 22h29m11.238478174s
```

**Debugging**

Please check if your Kubelet is correctly returning pod metrics.

You can do that by checking resource metrics on node where pod with missing metrics is running (can be checked by running `kubectl -n <pod_namespace> describe pod <pod_name>`:
```console
NODE_NAME=<Name of node in your cluster>
kubectl get --raw /api/v1/nodes/$NODE_NAME/proxy/metrics/resource
```

**Known causes**

* [Kubelet doesn't report pod metrics in Kubernetes 1.19 with Docker <v19](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94281)

  **Workaround**

  Upgrade Docker to v19.03


* [Minikube doesn't enable Kubelet metrics by default](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/issues/1018)

  **Workaround**

  When launching minikube set `kubelet.housekeeping-interval`, for example `minikube start --extra-config=kubelet.housekeeping-interval=10s`

## HPA is unable to get resource utilization

**Symptoms**


When running Deployment with horizontal autoscaling, HPA fails to compute replica count and reports error `failed to get memory utilization: missing request for memory`, even though Deployment sets resource requests. For example when running:
```
$ kubectl describe hpa 
```
will return
```

```
**Debugging**

* Check if all pods under HPA label selector have cpu and memory requests set.

**Known solutions**

* Set cpu and memory requests on all pods under label selector.
* Change HPA label selector or pods labels so that pods without requests are no longer picked up.

## Incorrectly configured front-proxy certificate

**Symptoms**


**Debuging**

Please check if your metrics server reports problem with authenticating client certificate, in particular errors mentioning `Unable to authenticate the request due to an error`. You can check logs by running command:
```
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=metrics-server --container metrics-server
```

Problem with front-proxy certificate can be recognized if logs have line similar to one below:
```
E0524 01:37:36.055326       1 authentication.go:65] Unable to authenticate the request due to an error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

**Known Causes**

* kubeadm uses separate `front-proxy` certificates that are not signed by main cluster certificate authority. 

  To fix this problem you need to provide kube-apiserver proxy-client CA to Metrics Server under `--requestheader-client-ca-file` flag. You can read more about this flag in [Authenticating Proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authenticating-proxy)




  1. Find your front-proxy certificates by checking arguments passed in kube-apiserver config (by default located in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml)

     ```
     - --proxy-client-cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.crt
     - --proxy-client-key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.key
     ```

  2. Create configmap including `front-proxy-ca.crt`

      ```
      kubectl -nkube-system create configmap front-proxy-ca --from-file=front-proxy-ca.crt=/etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.crt -o yaml | kubectl -nkube-system replace configmap front-proxy-ca -f -
      ```

  3. Mount configmap in Metrics Server deployment and add `--requestheader-client-ca-file` flag

      ```
        - args:
          - --requestheader-client-ca-file=/ca/front-proxy-ca.crt // ADD THIS!
          - --cert-dir=/tmp
          - --secure-port=4443
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /tmp
            name: tmp-dir
          - mountPath: /ca // ADD THIS!
            name: ca-dir
        volumes:
        - emptyDir: {}
          name: tmp-dir
        - configMap: // ADD THIS!
            defaultMode: 420
            name: front-proxy-ca
          name: ca-dir
      ```

## Network problem when connecting with Kubelet

**Symptoms**

When running `kubectl top nodes` we get partial or no information. For example results like:
```
NAME         CPU(cores) CPU%      MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%     
k8s-node01   59m        5%        1023Mi          26%         
k8s-master   <unknown>  <unknown> <unknown>       <unknown>               
k8s-node02   <unknown>  <unknown> <unknown>       <unknown>         
```

**Debugging**

Please check if your metrics server reports problems with connecting to Kubelet address, in particular errors will include `dial tcp IP(or hostname):10250: i/o timeout`. You can check logs by running command:

```
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=metrics-server --container metrics-server
```

Problem with network can be recognized if logs have line similar to one below:
```
unable to fully collect metrics: [unable to fully scrape metrics from source kubelet_summary:k8s-master: unable to fetch metrics from Kubelet k8s-master
(192.168.17.150): Get https://192.168.17.150:10250/stats/summary?only_cpu_and_memory=true: dial tcp 192.168.17.150:10250: i/o timeout
```

**Known solutions**
* [Calico] Check whether the value of `CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR` in the calico.yaml conflicts with the local physical network segment. The default: `192.168.0.0/16`.

  See [Kubernetes in Calico] for more details.

[Kubernetes in Calico]: https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/quickstart

* [Firewall rules/Security groups] Check firewall configuration on your nodes. The reason may be in closed ports for incoming connections, so the metrics server cannot collect metrics from other nodes.

## Unable to work properly in Amazon EKS

**Symptoms**

When running metrics-server in Amazon EKS, can't collect metrics from containers, pods, or nodes.

**Debugging**

Please check the metrics-server log, whether there is the following information

```
E0413 12:28:25.449973 1 authentication.go:65] Unable to authenticate the request due to an error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

**Known solutions**

* If you access your cluster through a role defined in the aws-auth ConfigMap, confirm that you have set the username field and the mapping. 



  1. To describe the aws-auth ConfigMap, run the following command:

      ```
      kubectl describe -n kube-system configmap aws-auth
      ```
  

  2. Confirm that the username field is set for the role accessing the cluster. See the following example:

      ```
      Name:         aws-auth
      Namespace:    kube-system
      Labels:       <none>
      Annotations:  <none>
      Data
      mapRoles: 
      -
      groups:
      - system:masters
        rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/kubernetes-devops
        username: devops:{{SessionName}}  # Ensure this has been specified.
      ```
