Launch metrics-server

Usage:
   [flags]

Metrics server flags:

      --kubeconfig string            The path to the kubeconfig used to connect to the Kubernetes API server and the Kubelets (defaults to in-cluster config)
      --metric-resolution duration   The resolution at which metrics-server will retain metrics, must set value at least 10s. (default 1m0s)
      --version                      Show version

Kubelet client flags:

      --deprecated-kubelet-completely-insecure    DEPRECATED: Do not use any encryption, authorization, or authentication when communicating with the Kubelet. This is rarely the right option, since it leaves kubelet communication completely insecure.  If you encounter auth errors, make sure you've enabled token webhook auth on the Kubelet, and if you're in a test cluster with self-signed Kubelet certificates, consider using kubelet-insecure-tls instead.
      --kubelet-certificate-authority string      Path to the CA to use to validate the Kubelet's serving certificates.
      --kubelet-client-certificate string         Path to a client cert file for TLS.
      --kubelet-client-key string                 Path to a client key file for TLS.
      --kubelet-insecure-tls                      Do not verify CA of serving certificates presented by Kubelets.  For testing purposes only.
      --kubelet-port int                          The port to use to connect to Kubelets. (default 10250)
      --kubelet-preferred-address-types strings   The priority of node address types to use when determining which address to use to connect to a particular node (default [Hostname,InternalDNS,InternalIP,ExternalDNS,ExternalIP])
      --kubelet-use-node-status-port              Use the port in the node status. Takes precedence over --kubelet-port flag.

Apiserver secure serving flags:

      --bind-address ip                        The IP address on which to listen for the --secure-port port. The associated interface(s) must be reachable by the rest of the cluster, and by CLI/web clients. If blank or an unspecified address (0.0.0.0 or ::), all interfaces will be used. (default 0.0.0.0)
      --cert-dir string                        The directory where the TLS certs are located. If --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file are provided, this flag will be ignored. (default "apiserver.local.config/certificates")
      --http2-max-streams-per-connection int   The limit that the server gives to clients for the maximum number of streams in an HTTP/2 connection. Zero means to use golang's default.
      --permit-address-sharing                 If true, SO_REUSEADDR will be used when binding the port. This allows binding to wildcard IPs like 0.0.0.0 and specific IPs in parallel, and it avoids waiting for the kernel to release sockets in TIME_WAIT state. [default=false]
      --permit-port-sharing                    If true, SO_REUSEPORT will be used when binding the port, which allows more than one instance to bind on the same address and port. [default=false]
      --secure-port int                        The port on which to serve HTTPS with authentication and authorization. If 0, don't serve HTTPS at all. (default 443)
      --tls-cert-file string                   File containing the default x509 Certificate for HTTPS. (CA cert, if any, concatenated after server cert). If HTTPS serving is enabled, and --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file are not provided, a self-signed certificate and key are generated for the public address and saved to the directory specified by --cert-dir.
      --tls-cipher-suites strings              Comma-separated list of cipher suites for the server. If omitted, the default Go cipher suites will be used.
                                               Preferred values: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.
                                               Insecure values: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256, TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA.
      --tls-min-version string                 Minimum TLS version supported. Possible values: VersionTLS10, VersionTLS11, VersionTLS12, VersionTLS13
      --tls-private-key-file string            File containing the default x509 private key matching --tls-cert-file.
      --tls-sni-cert-key namedCertKey          A pair of x509 certificate and private key file paths, optionally suffixed with a list of domain patterns which are fully qualified domain names, possibly with prefixed wildcard segments. The domain patterns also allow IP addresses, but IPs should only be used if the apiserver has visibility to the IP address requested by a client. If no domain patterns are provided, the names of the certificate are extracted. Non-wildcard matches trump over wildcard matches, explicit domain patterns trump over extracted names. For multiple key/certificate pairs, use the --tls-sni-cert-key multiple times. Examples: "example.crt,example.key" or "foo.crt,foo.key:*.foo.com,foo.com". (default [])

Apiserver authentication flags:
